## Project: CI-CD-with-Jenkins-DockerHub

I designed and implemented an end-to-end automation pipeline utilizing Jenkins and DockerHub to streamline the software development lifecycle. The pipeline orchestrated the following processes:

1. **Source Code Integration:** Utilized Jenkins to pull source code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Docker Image Creation:** Automated the building of Docker images for the application using Jenkins pipelines.
3. **DockerHub Integration:** Integrated Jenkins with DockerHub to seamlessly push the newly created Docker images to the designated repository.
4. **Image Lifecycle Management:** Implemented automated removal of outdated Docker images as part of the deployment process, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

This project significantly enhanced the development workflow, reducing manual intervention, ensuring consistent deployments, and optimizing resource consumption through automated image cleanup. It showcased my expertise in DevOps practices, containerization, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) methodologies.
